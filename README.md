# Truth-Table-Generator
This is a truth table generator. It works with the logic portion of discrete mathematics. You input variables, symbols, and parenthesis and in return it outputs a complete truth table showing all the steps along the way. 

The table excpects valid input, any letters can be used as variables, but lowercase and uppercase are the same (a = A : a != B)

If parenthesis are off or a operand is in a invalid loction it will not work
